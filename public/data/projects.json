The business was short-lived due to kitchen space and time constraints, but I decided to create a website as a side project to give it a professional online presence.\n\nI built a **single-page application (SPA)** using:\n\n* **React** for component-based structure\n* **Vite** for fast development and builds\n* **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and rapid UI prototyping\n\nThe site included:\n\n* A **menu** of available items\n* A **FAQ** section\n* **Contact information** for placing orders\n* Necessary **disclaimers**\n\n#### What Was Tricky\n\n* Making the site **mobile-friendly** while keeping it lightweight as a SPA\n* Establishing a **consistent theme** and UI that reflected the brand's food focus\n* Choosing **fonts and styles** that felt authentic yet modern â€” a design decision I'm particularly proud of\n\n#### What I Gained\n\n* Strengthened my **Tailwind CSS** skills in real-world responsive design\n* Improved my **mobile-first workflow**, especially testing layouts on different screen sizes\n* Practiced delivering a **polished SPA** quickly under minimal requirements\n\n#### Reflection\n\nAlthough Halalsters was paused, the project gave me practical experience in building a user-facing product that balanced functionality and branding. If the business were revived, I'd extend the site to include **online ordering and payment integration** to better serve customers."
